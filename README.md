This is a python project to encode an image into qr code. It comprises of two parts Split_image_into_qr.py and Reconstruction.py. 
The file Split_image_into_qr.py takes the image file, divides it into four quadrants, and encodes it into qr codes.
The file Reconstruction.py takes the four qr codes containing quadrant data, decodes them and stiches them back to re-create the original image.
